                Education. The Ministry of Primary and Mass Education is responsible for implementing policy for primary
                education and state-funded schools at a local level. In Bangladesh, all citizens must undertake twelve
                years of compulsory education which consists of eight years at primary school level and four years at
                high school level. Primary and secondary education is financed by the state and free of charge in public

                education in English or Bangla. Private schools tend to make use of English-based study media while
                government-sponsored schools use Bangla.
                Cadets in a classroom

                Cadet Colleges are important in the education system of Bangladesh. A cadet college is a room and board
                collegiate administered by the Bangladesh Military. Discipline is compulsory at all cadet colleges.
                Faujdarhat Cadet College is the first cadet college in Bangladesh, established in 1958 over an area of
                185 acres (0.75 km2) at Faujdarhat in the district of Chittagong. At present, there are 12 cadet
                colleges in Bangladesh, including three for girls.

                As of September 2019, tertiary education in Bangladesh takes place at 44 government, 101 private and 3
                international universities. Students can choose to further their studies in chartered accountancy,
                engineering, technology, agriculture and medicine at a variety of universities and colleges. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The overall responsibility of management of primary education lies with
                the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education (MOPME), set up as a Ministry in 1992. While MOPME is
                involved in formulation of policies, the responsibility of implementation rests with the Directorate of
                Primary Education (DPE) headed by a Director General. The Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) and its
                subordinate offices in the district and upazila are solely responsible for management and supervision of
                primary education. Their responsibilities include recruitment, posting, and transfer of teachers and
                other staff; arranging in-service training of teachers; distribution of free textbooks; and supervision
                of schools. The responsibility of school construction, repair and supply of school furniture lies with
                the DPE executed through the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED). The National Curriculum and
                Textbook Board (NCTB) is responsible for the development of curriculum and production of textbooks.
                While the Ministry of Education (MOE) is responsible for formulation of policies, the Directorate of
                Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE) under the Ministry of Education is responsible for implementing
                the same at secondary and higher education levels. The NCTB is responsible for developing curriculum and
                publishing standard textbooks.</p>
